# Azure AI Search Explorer

Azure AI Search Explorer is a lightweight GUI for exploring and managing an Azure AI Search service.
It helps you create and inspect indexes, ingestion pipelines (data sources, indexers, skillsets), and run queries (full-text, vector, hybrid).
Under the hood it uses Azure AI Search REST APIs, making it useful for learning, debugging, and validating configurations.
